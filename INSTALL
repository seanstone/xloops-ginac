Prerequisites
=============

xloops-GiNaC requires the GiNaC library for symbolic computation in C++
which can be obtained from http://www.ginac.de. The required minimum version
you need to have installed is GiNaC 0.9.4.


Installation
============

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as this:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
[become root if necessary]
 # make install

With certain versions of gcc, compilation can take a large amount of time and
memory when using the default optimization level -O2. If you're impatient,
you can specify a lower optimization level thus:

 $ make CXXFLAGS="-g -O1"

The "configure" script can be given a number of options to enable and
disable various features. For a complete list, type:

 $ ./configure --help

A few of the more important ones:

 --prefix=PREFIX        install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                        [defaults to /usr/local]
 --exec-prefix=EPREFIX  install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                        [defaults to the value given to --prefix]
 --with-ginac=DIR       if GiNaC is not sitting on a system-wide default place
                        you need to tell configure where to find it by using
                        this option. DIR must be a directory that contains
                        ginac/ginac.h and ginac/libginac.la
